# React--JS
## Introduction of react JSX
- JSX elements are treated as JavaScript expressions. They can go anywhere that JavaScript expressions can go.SX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or arrayâ€¦you name it.
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.A single JSX element can have many attributes.(id,src,alt,width,height)are some attribute
- Neasted JSX means You can add JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions
- To render a JSX expression means to make it appear onscreen.
- We can also Passing a Variable to ReactDOM.render()
- ReactDOM.render() is only updates DOM elements that have changed.That means if you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing. It only updating the necessary DOM elements is a large part of what makes React so successful.this is called Virtual DOM.
